                <p>
                    Welcome to Keyhome, your number one way to find housing. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of accommodations, with a focus on time-saving, finding what our customer wants, and making it as easy as possible.

                    Founded in 2021 by Vasil Todorov, Keyhome has come a long way from its beginnings in Eindhoven. When Vasil first started out, his passion for finding an easy way to offer accommodation to everyone drove him to do tons of research so that Keyhome can offer you accommodation without the hassles of other housing websites. We now serve customers all over The Netherlands and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.
